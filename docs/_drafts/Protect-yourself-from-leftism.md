You made some notes in your personal journal on 03 and 04/Jan/2024 about how Corgibytes has been these last few months. It seems their leftist ideology has corrupted their minds.  It _seems_ that they are either in a state of disbelief or something as they do not seem to be doing _everything possible_ to keep the company going. As Stephanie noted last night (03/Jan), it seems they are just letting the company dwindle down to just the bare minimum. What do they think we are going to do? How do they think we are paying our bills? Maybe they've let themselves believe we have other means of income? Government assistance? Not sure. Maybe Scott thinks it's somehow better for me to not have hours?
